A girl or guy’s voice can attract too. Guys – you ever speak to a girl whose voice makes you crazy attracted and you have no idea why? Girls – you ever talk to a guy and completely forget what he’s saying because his voice made you imagine what it would feel like if he just pushed you up against the wall and kissed you? That’s not by accident. It’s how our bodies work. Everybody’s senses are different. They say beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but the truth is, beauty is in the eye, nose and ear of the beholder!
Love Struck is designed to attract people near you using the power of sound. Just like a person’s voice may have the power to attract, so may certain sounds. These sounds don’t have to be able to be heard by you – just by your brain. You know you can’t hear the sound of a dog whistle, but a dog can hear the dog whistle? Think of Love Struck like that. It’s not meant for your ears – it’s made for your brain. Certain sounds may actually affect the way your brain chemistry works, and Love Struck is made to operate on that level, behind the scenes, helping you to attract.
