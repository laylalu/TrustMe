TrustMe
=======
A person’s voice can also have a profound effect on his or her ability to gain trust. Sometimes a person’s voice just inherently imbues a sense of trust, like Mr. Rogers or Morgan Freeman. Other times, it can have the opposite effect. That’s not by accident. It’s how our bodies work. Everybody’s senses are different.
Trust Me was designed to work for you by using the power of sound to instill a sense of trust in those around you. Just like a person’s voice may imbue trust, so may certain sounds. These sounds don’t have to be able to be heard by your ears – just by your brain. You know how you can’t hear the sound of a dog whistle, but a dog can hear the dog whistle? Think of Trust Me like that. It’s not meant for your ears – it’s made for your brain. Certain sounds may actually affect the way your brain chemistry works, and Trust Me was made to work on that level, behind the scenes, helping others trust you. Like a secret weapon – just for you.
